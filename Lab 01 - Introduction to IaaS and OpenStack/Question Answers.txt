What happens if you lose your ssh KeyPair file? What happens to 
existing instances which were started with the lost ssh key?

By losing my private SSH key I would no longer be able to access 
existing instances that were started using my public key if I didnâ€™t
have any other means to access them.



What are the advantages of utilizing cloud Volumes? Briefly describe 
at least two scenarios, where using volumes simplifies working with 
cloud instances.

1. Multi-instance storage - volumes can be used to store data that
are shared between multiple instances.
2. Data persistence - volumes retain data after an instance is 
terminated, making it easier to preserve important data.
