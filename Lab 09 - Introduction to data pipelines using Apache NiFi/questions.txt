1. Which of the available NiFi processors looks most interesting or useful to you (which was NOT covered in this lab). 
Why do you find it interesting or useful?

ExecuteScript, it allows to execute custom scripts written in Python, Javascrpt, Lua, etc.
I can write custom scripts to perform complex data processing tasks that may not be possible with other built-in processors.



2. Explain what is copy-on-write paradigm that NiFi Content Repository uses.

When a change is made to a FlowFile, NiFi makes a copy of the original FlowFile's content. All modifications are done one the copy. 
This ensures that the original FlowFile remains unchanged and that all provenance events that reference it still point to the correct content.
The copy operation is deferred until the first write.

Why is copy-on-write useful when dealing with large amount of streaming data?

If a resource is duplicated but not modified, it is not necessary to create a new resource. The resource can be shared between the copy and the original.
When multiple processors need to access and modify the same data, copy-on-write allows them to do so without interfering with each other's operations.
