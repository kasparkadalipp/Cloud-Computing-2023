Take a look at the different options available in the table. Note the resources and cost. 
Write down your observation/discussion - how much would a VM similar to our OpenStacks "m2.tiny" 
used in previous labs cost on Azure? Note down the name of the similar VM, and list its specs.

  Name   |  VCPUs  |   RAM  |  Total Disk  |  Max IOPS  |      Cost
---------|---------|--------|--------------|------------|--------------
m2.tiny  |   2GB   |   4GB  |      10GB    |            |   
B2s      |   2GB   |   4GB  |       8GB    |     1280   |  32.85$ month
F2s_v2   |   2GB   |   4GB  |      16GB    |     3200   |  70.08$ month





In which order are the 4 components deployed?
Why are they being deployed in this order?

1. Azure Platform
2. AzureResourceGroup
3. AzureStorageAccount
4. AzureHttpTriggeredFunction

Azure Platform is deplyed first, because everything else is hosted on it
AzureResourceGroup is next, because AzureStorageAccount depends on it
and AzureHttpTriggeredFunction is last, because it depends on AzureStorageAccount
